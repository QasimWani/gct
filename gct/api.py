""" 
Graphical Code Tracer (GCT) is a static code analysis tool that generates 
a graphical representation of a Python program. It shows how different parts
of the program interact with each other. GCT is built on top of the AST module
and thus isn't always 100% accurate due to the dynamic nature of Python.

GCT, however, still provides a good overview of the program and can be used
to quickly identify potential bugs, understand the general flow of a program,
and onboard new developers to any python codebase.

GCT is currently limited to file-level tracing. This means that it can only
trace functions and classes that are defined in the same file. If you enjoy
GCT, please consider contributing to the project to extend its functionality.

Running GCT on any python3 file is as simple as:

>>> import gct.api as api
>>> path = "example/arithmetics.py"
>>> graph, code = api.run(path)
>>> api.render(graph, file_name="temp/graph", output_format="pdf")

If you want to load the svg object in memory instead of saving it to a file, 
leave `file_name` in api.run as None.
>>> svg_as_string = api.run(graph)
